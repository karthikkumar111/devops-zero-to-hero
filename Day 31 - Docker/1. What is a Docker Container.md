# 🐳 What is a Docker Container?

A **Docker container** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes **everything needed to run an application**: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Containers are created from **Docker images** and provide an isolated environment for running applications reliably across different computing environments.

## 🧱 Key Features of Docker Containers

* ✅ Lightweight: Shares the host OS kernel, unlike VMs which require full guest OS.
* 🚀 Fast Startup: Launches in seconds.
* 🧩 Portable: Runs the same way in development, testing, and production.
* 🔐 Isolated: Each container runs independently in its own environment.
* 🔁 Immutable: Containers are based on images, which are read-only and versioned.
