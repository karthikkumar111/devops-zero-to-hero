## What is a Docker Image?

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application â€” the **code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files**.

Think of a Docker image as a **blueprint or snapshot** of a container. It contains the instructions for creating and running a Docker container.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics of Docker Image:

* **Immutable**: Once built, a Docker image cannot be changed. Any updates require a new image build.
* **Layered**: Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. Layers are stacked and cached for faster builds.
* **Portable**: You can move Docker images across systems and environments without modification.
* **Read-only**: Docker containers run from read-only images. The container itself adds a writable layer on top.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Example:

When you run the following command:

```bash
docker run ubuntu
```

Docker pulls the **Ubuntu image** from Docker Hub (if not already available locally) and then runs it in a container.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Components Inside a Docker Image:

* Base Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine)
* Application code (e.g., a Python script)
* Dependencies and libraries (e.g., Python packages)
* Environment variables
* Start-up commands (defined via CMD or ENTRYPOINT)

---

### ðŸ”¸ Where Are Docker Images Stored?

* **Locally**: On your system under Dockerâ€™s storage (can be listed using `docker images`).
* **Remotely**: On Docker registries like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), or [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages).
